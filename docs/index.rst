=====================
First Python Notebook
=====================

A step-by-step guide to analyzing data with Python and the Jupyter notebook.

What you will learn
===================

This textbook will guide you through an investigation of money in politics using data from the `California Civic Data Coalition <http://www.californiacivicdata.org/>`_.

You will learn just enough of the `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ computer programming language to work with the `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ library, a popular open-source tool for analyzing data. The course will teach you how to read, filter, join, group, aggregate and rank structured data.

You will also learn how to record, remix and republish your analysis using the `Jupyter notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_, a browser-based application for writing code that is emerging as the standard for sharing reproducible research.


Who can take it
===============

This course is free. If you've tried Python once or twice, have good attitude and know how to take a few code crashes in stride, you are qualified. But before you begin be sure to review the :doc:`prerequisites </prerequisites/index>`.
