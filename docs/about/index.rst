About this class
****************

This course was first developed for an October 2016, `"watchdog workshop" <http://www.californiacivicdata.org/2016/10/08/first-python-notebook/>`_ organized by Investigative Reporters and Editors at San Diego State University's school of journalism.

It was revised for a February 2017 hands-on training of students at Stanford's journalism school and expanded into `a six-hour class <https://www.ire.org/events-and-training/event/2702/2879/>`_ at the annual conference of the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting in March 2017.

It was expanded into its current form for `a massive open online course <https://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/00-18396-sign-now-our-new-online-course-data-journalism-python-data-journalists-analyzing-money>`_ offered by the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas in May 2017.

Since then, the course has been taught more than a dozen times in classrooms and at conferences across America and around the world.

About the data
**************

The course is based on data provided by the `California Civic Data Coalition <http://www.californiacivicdata.org/>`_, an open-source network of journalists and computer programmers working to ease access to the state's jumbled, dirty and difficult database tracking money in politics.

The goal of the coalition's work is to make the data those reporters used easier to access, understand and analyze. Learn more about the status of the project and the data you can download at `californiacivicdata.org <http://www.californiacivicdata.org/2016/09/15/website-launch/>`_.
